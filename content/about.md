My name is Ellis Hughes. I am an avid R programmer, Seattle UseR organizer, and have a passion for solving problems. I enjoy being given a difficult task and finding a solution to fit business and user needs. I am employed at Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center as a Statistical Programmer in SCHARP (VISC). Most of the time I am programming in the R language, but have experience with additional data analysis languages; Python, Java, and MATLAB/Octave. I also enjoy learning new languages to solve my needs.

While a student at WSU, I had the opportunity to work in one of my Professors Labs. Under her direction, I developed individualized bio-mechanical models to evaluate neck strain. From these models, we were able to determine that there is a significant difference in neck strain during different tablet computer use cases. A paper has been published in Ergonomics.

I have an interest in medical device design and data analysis. If you have something that you think might interest me, feel free to connect with me and letâ€™s talk.
