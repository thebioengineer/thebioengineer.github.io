## Background

This site is where I will document my various observations, promote software I develop, and generally try to record thoughts over time. 

If you enjoy what you read, you can find me on twitter at [\@ellis_hughes](https://twitter.com/ellis_hughes), on github as [\@thebioengineer](https://github.com/thebioengineer), or LinkedIn under... [my name](https://linkedin.com/in/ellishughes).

I also run a weekly screencast called TidyX where I and my co-host Patrick Ward go through and explain how R code and concepts work and are applied. If you like that, you can subscribe to our [youtube channel](bit.ly/TidyX_Chanel).
