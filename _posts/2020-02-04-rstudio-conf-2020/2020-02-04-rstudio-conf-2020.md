Last week I had the pleasure of speaking at RStudio::conf on a project that I have been working on and developing with my team for a number of months now:

> Validation of R packages

The focus of the presentation was to share an approach to simplify the process of validation of R packages. 
My motivation and development of this approach comes from developing an internal package that needed validation. 

At most organizations, the process of validation is cumbersome and difficult.
External documents are manually tracked and updated.
If anything changed, most everything had to be rewritten. 

I found the biggest barrier was caused by separating the validation process from the package development.
This created breaks in project flows for the sake of documentation.

By using the framework I suggest, the validation process can be integrated into package development and updating the documentation is a breeze.

The repository that holds the presentation and a sample R package can be found at [github.com/thebioengineer/validation](https://www.github.com/thebioengineer/validation).

The slides are at [https://thebioengineer.github.io/validation](https://thebioengineer.github.io/validation).

A more in-depth conversation on R packages and Validation is coming.
