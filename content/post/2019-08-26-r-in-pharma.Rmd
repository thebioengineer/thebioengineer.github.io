Below  are the slides I presented at this years [R/Pharma](rinpharma.com) conference. It was a blast and I met so many great people. I learned about the many ways R is being used in the industry, and how there is a huge push towards collaboration and transparancy in sharing our code. 

I discussed our approach to creating the documentaion required to validate an internally generated R package and lessons learned working in a group.
