      <description>My name is Ellis Hughes. I am an avid R programmer, Seattle UseR organizer, and have a passion for solving problems. I enjoy being given a difficult task and finding a solution to fit business and user needs. I am employed at Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center as a Statistical Programmer in SCHARP (VISC). Most of the time I am programming in the R language, but have experience with additional data analysis languages; Python, Java, and MATLAB/Octave.</description>

      <description>Below are the slides I presented at this years R/Pharma conference. It was a blast and I met so many great people. I learned about the many ways R is being used in the industry, and how there is a huge push towards collaboration and transparancy in sharing our code.
I discussed our approach to creating the documentaion required to validate an internally generated R package and lessons learned working in a group.</description>

      <description>Reinforcement learning is an interesting technique where in the user gives a model a game state and requests that it produce some sort of reaction to the state. This action is then fed back into the model to generate the next state. If the result of this action is a positive reaction, it is recorded and the model is fit to imply this action is a good one.</description>
