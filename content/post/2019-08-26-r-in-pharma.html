<p>Below are the slides I presented at this years <a href="rinpharma.com">R/Pharma</a> conference. It was a blast and I met so many great people. I learned about the many ways R is being used in the industry, and how there is a huge push towards collaboration and transparancy in sharing our code.</p>
<p>I discussed our approach to creating the documentaion required to validate an internally generated R package and lessons learned working in a group.</p>
